You can use this app to manage your finances. 

**With features like** 
 - The dashboard, where you can see an overview of your wallets, incomes and expenses.
 - My wallets, where you can add and edit wallets.
 - Categories, where you can add and edit custom categories that actually fit with what you spend on
 - Transactions, where you can see and edit all the movements that you've done with your money.

## How it Started
This project started in November 2, 2022. After starting a React course I decided that it was better to use my time to create something real, since I hadn't created a real project with different front-end and back-end.

I decided to make it about finances becuase I use an app on my phone but I had to pay to get all the features. Also, that app is for phones only, I couldn't  access my information from other devices and with a Web App I could solve that issue.

## Guide
First thing you have to do to start using the App is create an account
Once you have an account you have to create at least 1 wallet and 1 category. When you have that you can start adding transactions.
